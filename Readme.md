# client side app boilerplate code

This is boilerplate code for easy, client-side application asset compilation.

## assumptions

- assets are all compiled using gulp
- assets are assumed to be in the ``/src`` directory.
- all .js files become ``/public/app.min.js``
- all .jade files become ``/public/templates.min.js``
- all .less files become ``/public/styles.min.css``
